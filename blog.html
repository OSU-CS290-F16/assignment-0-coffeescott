      <p>
             For this first assignment allot of the work wasn't about the HTML.
		<br> In fact very little of the time I spent was the programming. 
		<br> For me this 0 week was all about learning the interfaces.
		<br>
		<br> Exploreing Github and Piazza while connecting to the ENGR servers. 
		<br> Allot of what I learned isn't "learning" Web Development exactly
		<br>  but is extemely important in order to move forward.
		<br> 
		<br> I focus on how to deal with the github enviornment.
		<br> I have a grasp on using ENGR and setting up my cs290 file 
		<br> so that aspect of the class was familiar. I would imagine it to 
		<br> be very frustrating to come in as a transfer student and try to absord 
		<br> completely new enviornments week 0.
		<br>
		<br> For all of the HTML itself I found that my notes from friday's class lecture
		<br> were sufficient for everything I had to do.
		<br> for many of the github and commit/push and git I find that Google is 
		<br> a great resource for simple questions.
		<br>
		<br> Overall a good 0 week. Next time around I will have a better
		<br> grasp with the enviornment and the background processes will click together
		<br> so I can focus more on expanding my HTML skills.
