        Hello my name is <strong> Scott </strong>! <br> 
        I'm a Computer Science student with a focus on Animation and Simulation. <br>
        This will by my 4th year here at Oregon State :) <br>
        From 1-10 my Web Development skills are probably a 3-4. <br>
        I understand website elements and design but I have not worked with the syntax of web development before. <br>
        <br>
        During and from this class I hope to:
       <ul>
         <li> Create a website that I would personally use. </li>
         <li> Design with a user friendly layout. </li>
         <li> Engage and improve my software skills. </li>
         <li> L33t H@x </li>
         <li> Have lots of fun along the way. =D </li>    
      </ul>
         I have signed up for Piazza. At first I thought it was called 'Pizza'. I am very experience with Pizza. ^_^
